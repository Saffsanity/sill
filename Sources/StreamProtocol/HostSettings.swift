// The Mac's settings as a device sees and changes them (kinds 16 and 17, see StreamMessage.swift):
// five for the stream, and one (Direct Wireless) for how devices reach the Mac. Rules for every
// later change, because older builds of either side must keep decoding what newer ones send:
//
// • A device knows the host supports settings when a `.hostSettings` arrives on this connection,
//   never by a version: `WindowList.hostVersion` is nil from SillHost, and it and `protocol`
//   (Switcher.swift) are nil from hosts before 2026-09-25.
// • Kind numbers are never reused: a new kind takes the next free number, and an older reader maps
//   a kind it does not know to `.unknown` and skips it (StreamMessage.swift).
// • Fields added later must be optional: a missing required key fails the whole decode, and the
//   device would then treat the Mac as an older one.
// • Never remove, rename or retype a field (Swift property names are the JSON keys).
// • No enums in these payloads: an unknown case would fail an older reader's whole decode, while
//   JSONDecoder ignores unknown keys, so either side can add fields.
// • A field a host did not report (nil in its state: an older host) is never sent to it. The
//   device's ledger enforces it (its rule 9), so an older host is never asked for what it cannot
//   show.
//
// Compatibility.swift adds three rules for every session: the device's hello (kind 23) first, a
// `Goodbye.reason` always sent, and a refusal as kind 22 "update" with `"reconnect":false`.
//
// A new setting has to be added everywhere the others are listed by hand, and the compiler points
// at few of those places. Missing the host's whitelist is silent: a device's change is dropped with
// no refusal and no log line, the answer shows the old value, and the device takes that for a
// refusal. The places:
// • here: `StreamSettings` (optional), `HostSettingsChange` with `isEmpty` and `applied(to:)`, and
//   `SettingsChoices` when the setting takes a fixed set of values;
// • the host: `HostConfig` (`validated()`, `changes(to:)`), `streamSettings`, `applying` and
//   `DeviceSettings.accepted` in DeviceSettings.swift, and `StreamCoordinator.restartNeeded` when
//   the running pipeline depends on it;
// • Sill.app: `HostSettings` (its key, registered default, load and `save(changedFrom:)`),
//   `DebugHooks.apply` (`-SillSetAfter`), and the status menu and Settings panes when the Mac
//   shows it;
// • the device: `SettingsField` and `HostSettingsChange.fields`, `only` and `adding`
//   (HostSettingsLedger.swift), rule 9 in the ledger's `pick` for an optional field, the panel's
//   row, and the DEBUG mock's cases (MockCatalog.swift);
// • Scripts/sillclient.py: the keys `--set` accepts, and `describe`.
//
// A Mac-only listener knob (remote access, its port, internet access) goes in the host's
// HostConfig, the app's HostSettings, DebugHooks, the Remote Access pane and the menu, and never in
// StreamSettings, HostSettingsChange or DeviceSettings.accepted: only the Mac's own user widens
// who can reach the Mac. Require pairing (docs/home-pairing-plan.md §4.1, §6.5) is one too, and
// stricter still: it lives in the identity store beside the trust list, never in the app's
// HostSettings (UserDefaults) or a launch argument, since any process of this user can write those.
