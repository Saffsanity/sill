// The Mac's menus on the device (kinds 24, 25 and 27, see StreamMessage.swift; docs/menu-bar-plan.md
// §3): the streamed app's menu bar, read on the Mac over Accessibility, one menu at a time when the
// device opens it, and an item chosen there pressed on the Mac. HostSettings.swift's rules apply to
// all four types: JSON only; fields added later are optional; strings, not enums; never rename or
// retype a field. A later "alternate of the item above" flag, or an SF Symbol name from a Catalyst
// app, would be an optional field.
//
// Who is sent what:
// • A device asks once per connection, with a kind 27 without an id, after its first window list.
//   Only such a connection (a subscriber) is ever sent a top level, and the host reads nothing for
//   a connection that never asked: an older device, which sends no kind 27, costs the Mac nothing.
// • The version is the host's, one for all devices (there is one stream, so one app). It moves
//   whenever the app whose menus these are changes (to none included), or a re-read finds the top
//   level's titles, count or enabled flags changed. An id is good only within its version: a kind
//   25 or 27 with another version is answered at once and never read or pressed.
// • Tokens are the device's, strictly increasing per connection, as kind 17's are; the host only
//   echoes them in `answering`.
//
// Pure: Foundation only, so it is checked on its own with swiftc (Tests/checks/menus).
