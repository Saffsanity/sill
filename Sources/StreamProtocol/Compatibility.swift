import Foundation

// Compatibility between builds of the Mac and the device (docs/update-notice-plan.md §3): the
// device's hello (kind 23), the versions both ends compare, and the wire's generation. The rules of
// HostSettings.swift apply to every payload here (JSON only; fields added later are optional; no
// enums on the wire; never rename or retype a field), with three more:
//
// • A device's first message on a session connection is its hello. A host never assumes one
//   arrives: older devices send none.
// • `Goodbye.reason` is always sent (Remote.swift). A new reason carries a `message` that a device
//   from 2026-09-25 on can show as it is, and `reconnect`.
// • A refusal is kind 22 "update" with `"reconnect":false`, and nothing is sent before it.
//
// Pure: Foundation only, so it is checked on its own with swiftc.

/// The wire's generation. 1: the 14-byte header, kinds 0–23 and the JSON rules of HostSettings.swift,
/// inside TLS 1.3 with both keys pinned at both doors, whose session protocol is the ALPN `sill/1`
/// (RemoteTLS.sessionALPN): the home door pairs as the remote door does, as the first public builds
/// ship it (docs/home-pairing-plan.md; the plain home door is development builds' and the CLI's).
/// Raised only by a change an older peer cannot skip (a new transport, a kind or rule it cannot
/// skip); an additive change never raises it. When it rises, a later session ALPN (`sill/2`) goes
/// beside `sill/1` and `sill-pair/1`, which every host offers for good (RemoteTLS.serverALPNs), and
/// the host's device floor rises with it (DeviceGate, docs/update-notice-plan.md §4.6): a device
/// from the first public build speaks only `sill/1`, and hears kind 22 "update" only inside it, so a
/// host that no longer serves it still completes that handshake, reads its hello through the gate
/// and refuses it with "update".
