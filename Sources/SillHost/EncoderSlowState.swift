/// Whether a hardware stream's session has settled in the encoder engine's slow state, and whether
/// the new session HEVCEncoder then gives the stream runs any faster. Pure (Foundation only):
/// HEVCEncoder keeps it under its lock and tells it about every frame the capture delivers, every
/// frame that comes back encoded (with its turnaround: hand-over to output) and when a new session
/// took over; it is checked on its own with swiftc against scripted streams in virtual time
/// (`Scripts/encoder-check/run.sh slowstate`).
///
/// The slow state (CLAUDE.md, "The 33 fps plateau"), measured alone on the engine at 3024×1964:
/// every fresh session started fast (9 ms a frame, then ~16 ms paced to 57 fps); about a second
/// into a quiet spell an isolated frame took 29 ms, and once motion resumed every frame did for as
/// long as it lasted (90 s of 90): 34 fps out of 57 captured, one frame inside at a time.
///
/// The rule: a session that has run fast (a frame back in under `slowTurnaround`) and now, over the
/// last `window` seconds, gets at least `minInputFPS` frames from the capture in each second while
/// the median turnaround of what came back is at least `slowTurnaround`, is replaced
/// (`Event.replace`), at most once per `minSpacing`. The new session is timed on its frames after
/// its first (a keyframe) and `Event.judged` reports it; one no faster (then the engine is slow, not
/// the session) ends the replacing for this stream (`gaveUp`). A session that never ran fast (a
/// frame size the engine is simply slow at) is never replaced.
