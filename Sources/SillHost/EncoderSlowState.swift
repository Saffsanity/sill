/// Whether a hardware stream's session has settled in the encoder engine's slow state, and whether
/// the new session HEVCEncoder then gives the stream runs any faster. Pure (Foundation only):
/// HEVCEncoder keeps it under its lock and tells it about every frame the capture delivers, every
/// frame that comes back encoded (with its turnaround: hand-over to output) and when a new session
/// took over; it is checked on its own with swiftc against scripted streams in virtual time
/// (`Scripts/encoder-check/run.sh slowstate`).
///
/// The slow state (CLAUDE.md, "The 33 fps plateau"), measured alone on the engine at 3024×1964:
/// every fresh session started fast (9 ms a frame, then ~16 ms paced to 57 fps); about a second
/// into a quiet spell an isolated frame took 29 ms, and once motion resumed every frame did for as
/// long as it lasted (90 s of 90): 34 fps out of 57 captured, one frame inside at a time.
///
/// The rule: a session that has run fast (a frame back in under `slowTurnaround`) and now, over the
/// last `window` seconds, gets at least `minInputFPS` frames a second from the capture in each half
/// of the window while the median turnaround of what came back is at least `slowTurnaround` and at
/// least `slowFactor` times the fastest frame the session has returned, is replaced
/// (`Event.replace`), at most once per `minSpacing`. The factor keeps a session that is merely at
/// the engine's capacity near `slowTurnaround` (6880×2880 at 60 fps: 25.5 ms at the median, 24.65
/// at best) from being replaced for nothing, while the slow state is 1.8 times the paced fast
/// state (29 ms against 16) and 3.2 times a fresh session's 9. A session that never ran fast (a
/// frame size the engine is simply slow at) is never replaced.
///
/// The new session is timed on its frames after its first (a keyframe) while the motion that set
/// off the swap lasts (`inMotion`): the first frame handed over without it ends the timing, since
/// sparse frames make a session slow within about a second (seen in new sessions too: 29 ms a
/// frame 0.55 s after the picture stopped, and 15 ms once motion came back), so they say nothing
/// of how it keeps up with a stream. The verdict (`Event.judged`) comes at `judgeFrames` timed
/// frames, when the timing ends, or at the first frame back `judgeWithin` after the swap: the
/// median of those frames if there are at least `minJudged`, else none (the picture went still).
/// One no faster (its median at least `noFasterFraction` of the replaced session's: then the
/// engine is slow, as beside another app, not the session) ends the replacing for this stream
/// (`gaveUp`).
