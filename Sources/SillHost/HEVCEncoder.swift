/// HEVC encoder tuned for low latency: real time, no B-frames, keyframes on demand.
///
/// Threading, by hand and deliberately:
/// - `encode()` is called on the capture queue (and `requestKeyframe()` on the network queue or the
///   main actor). It never touches VideoToolbox itself and never waits: the frame is let in, or
///   waits in a one-slot mailbox, and it returns, so ScreenCaptureKit is never blocked by the
///   encoder. A newer frame replaces an older waiting one.
/// - `encodeQueue` (serial) hands frames to VideoToolbox one after another, in the order they were
///   let in (each is queued on it under the lock that let it in), so timestamps only go forward and
///   a requested keyframe goes with the next frame in.
///   One frame is inside VT at a time: the next goes in when the last came back, and a frame that
///   finds the place taken waits in the mailbox, where a newer one replaces it (`EncoderMailbox`,
///   which keeps this bookkeeping and is checked on its own). Latency beats quality: a frame the
///   encoder has no room for waits in the mailbox, never inside VT behind another. Two inside at
///   once was measured against the hardware's slow state and dropped (CLAUDE.md, "The 33 fps
///   plateau").
/// - A watchdog on its own queue declares the session dead when a frame has been inside VT
///   `hangAfter` seconds without an output. The owner is told (`onHung`) and starts over on the
///   software encoder, and leaves it again once a re-check finds the hardware keeping up with the
///   stream (StreamCoordinator, EncoderProbe). It has fired for two different reasons:
///   - Stuck. 2026-09-22 the Mac's hardware encoder wedged system-wide for about three hours: a
///     fresh session in a fresh process never returned a single frame. With the old direct call
///     that froze the capture queue, then `stopCapture`, then every later source switch.
///   - Busy. 2026-09-24, twice: the iOS Simulator's screen recorder runs its hardware session at
///     the encoder firmware's priority 80, a real-time session like this one at 0, and the one
///     encoder engine served the recorder while this session's frame waited 1.8 s and 8.6 s. Both
///     frames came back, and fresh sessions answered at once. The kernel's AppleAVE2 log showed it
///     (CLAUDE.md, "Frozen stream").
///   A session given up on reports on its way out whether its stalled frame ever came back
///   (`deinit`): a busy encoder hands it back, a stuck one never does.
/// - The hardware's slow state (CLAUDE.md, "The 33 fps plateau"): a session fed sparse frames for
///   about a second can settle at ~29 ms a frame instead of 9–16 and stay there through any motion
///   that follows (34 fps out of 57 captured at 3024×1964). When a stream's session does
///   (`EncoderSlowState`), the stream gets a new one in place (`replacesSlowSessions`): made on a
///   queue of its own while the old one goes on, taken at the next hand-over with a forced keyframe
///   (whose parameter sets go out with it), and the old one, holding no frame by then, invalidated.
///   The mailbox, its frame ids, the watchdog and the capture carry on: a new session never counts
///   against a frame's clock, and one that hangs is a hang like any other.
