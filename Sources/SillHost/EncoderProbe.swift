/// leaks the same). On 2026-09-24 it was busy: the iOS Simulator's screen recorder held the one
/// encoder engine at a higher firmware priority, and frames of real-time sessions waited seconds,
/// then came back. A small frame answers even then (256×256 within 270 ms while a stream-size
/// session beside it was still starved; on 2026-09-25 in 72 ms, and the stream that went back to
/// the hardware on that answer ran at 12 fps), which is why the re-check measures a rate at the
