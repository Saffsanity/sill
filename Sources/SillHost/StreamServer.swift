/// Test only, read once from the environment, never set outside a test and not in the README:
/// `SILL_TEST_SERVICE_TYPE=_silltest._tcp` registers a host that otherwise does not advertise (the
/// `--synthetic` hosts) as "Sill test ‹pid›" under that type, with the listener's own peer-to-peer
/// flag, so a dns-sd browse can check whether the registration includes AWDL while no device (they
/// browse `_sill._tcp` only) ever finds it. `SILL_TEST_SWAP_FAIL=port` makes a Direct Wireless
/// replacement's same-port bind fail as EADDRINUSE without binding, and `=all` its any-port bind
/// too, so the fallback and the listener-failure rule can be exercised without a real conflict.
/// `SILL_TEST_PEER_TO_PEER_INTERFACE=en0` counts a client whose address is scoped to that interface
/// as one on peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, so turning Direct Wireless off disconnects it: a link-local test
/// client on en0 stands in for a device on awdl0, which no test can reach.
/// `SILL_TEST_ORIGIN=vpn|internet` makes loopback sources classify as that origin, so the origin
/// gate can refuse a test client. `SILL_TEST_MIN_DEVICE_VERSION=1.2` raises the device floor
/// (DeviceGate) from "0", so the gate below runs, and `SILL_TEST_GOODBYE='<JSON>'` makes its
/// refusals send that kind 22 payload instead (a reason this build does not know, for the device's
/// tests). `SILL_TEST_LOOPBACK=1` makes both doors listen on 127.0.0.1 alone, so a test host takes
/// no connection from another machine (the Application Firewall never asks) and `lsof` shows it as
/// `127.0.0.1:PORT`: devices and test clients on this Mac, the simulator included, reach it by
/// 127.0.0.1. All are honoured only on a host that does not advertise, so a stray variable can never
/// touch a real host.
///
/// The home door (this listener) admits only loopback, link-local (AWDL included) and this Mac's
/// own networks (OriginPolicy), checked at `.ready` before anything is registered or sent: a
/// refused connection is cancelled with zero bytes from Sill and only counted, one summary line a
/// minute at most. Every client message is capped at `StreamMessage.maxClientPayload`.
///
/// The device gate (DeviceGate): with the floor above "0", a ready connection on either door is
/// held unregistered until its first message, which must be a hello the floor admits; any other
/// device gets kind 22 "update" and is closed, never registered. What changed while it was held is
/// judged again as it is admitted: Direct Wireless turned off (home), and the remote door's trust,
