// A device's key (kind 8's `.key`: a USB HID usage going down or up, with UIKeyModifierFlags bits) as
// the keyboard events InputInjector posts for it: the Mac's virtual key, and the flags each carries.
// Beside it, the check a quarter of a second after each key's up (`KeyUpCheck`).
//
// The flags are what a keyboard would give (2026-09-27, the stuck command after Spotlight). The Mac
// keeps the modifier state of the source InputInjector posts from in the HID system's state table:
// each keyboard event posted leaves its flags there (CGEventSource.h: the source's "accumulated
// information on modifier flag state", placed in effect by posting events), and every pointer and
// scroll event made from the source afterwards starts from them. A device sends a shortcut as one
// key down and up, each carrying its modifiers (the Spotlight key's ⌘Space, the key row's ⌘esc, a
// latched ⌘S), not with the modifier's own key pressed around it as a keyboard does; posted as it
// came, the up left command in the table, and the next tap was a ⌘-click until typed text (posted
// with no flags) cleared it. So:
//   - a key's down carries the modifiers its device sent and whatever modifier keys are down (a
//     Mac with two keyboards does the same): the shortcut acts on the down;
//   - a key's up carries only the modifiers the modifier keys down hold, never its chord's own;
//   - a modifier's own key (a latched modifier pressed around a click, a hardware keyboard's) is a
//     flags-changed event with what is held once it is down or up: never its own flag after its up
//     (unless the same modifier's other key is down), whatever the device said;
//   - a device's key or text saying it no longer holds a modifier lets go of that modifier's key
//     first (a device from before this fix never sent a hardware ⌘'s release);
//   - a device that leaves has every key it still holds down let go, and so does the host at its end;
//   - a trackpad gesture's shortcut (`chord`) goes down with its own flags and up with those the table
//     held before it.
// Pointer and scroll events are made from the source as before, so they start from what is held.
// Inferred, not observed: nothing may be posted while this is built, so every key's up is checked a
// quarter of a second later (`KeyUpCheck`). Typed text is InputInjector's: it goes out with no flags,
// after `text` has let go of the device's modifier keys.
//
// Pure: Foundation only, checked on its own with swiftc (Tests/checks/key-strokes; its `package`
// access needs -package-name sill). Nothing here posts anything: InputInjector makes each event from
// its source and posts it.
