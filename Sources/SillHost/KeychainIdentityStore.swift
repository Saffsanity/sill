/// Sill.app's identity store (docs/remote-access-plan.md §4.5, docs/keychain-plan.md): the Mac's key
/// and trust list in a keychain, in one of two keychains chosen at launch.
///
/// - **Legacy (`accessGroup` nil):** the file-based login keychain, as remote access first shipped.
///   Every item keeps the default access control, which trusts the app that made it by its
///   designated requirement, and that requirement survives rebuilds signed with the same identity,
///   as the TCC grants do. But the login keychain **does not authenticate who made an item**: any
///   process of this user can create an item first, list Sill among the apps allowed to read it, and
///   Sill then adopts it (the security review, 2026-09-27). So this store is used only where the
///   strong keychain is out of reach — a development build, or a release with no embedded
///   provisioning profile — and never by an entitled Sill.app.
/// - **Data-protection (`accessGroup` set, e.g. `9B2KKVM937.me.saffer.sill.mac`):** the
///   data-protection keychain under that access group. Only a process signed by the same team and
///   entitled to that group can create or read the items, so no other process can pre-create or read
///   them: the pre-creation hole is closed, and the key becomes unreadable to other apps as a bonus.
///   Reaching this keychain needs the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, hence a provisioning
///   profile embedded in the build (Scripts/make-app.sh --release, docs/release-checklist.md);
///   IdentityStorePlan picks it only when the running binary actually holds the entitlement.
///
/// The items, in either keychain:
/// - The key: a permanent P-256 private key, application tag `me.saffer.sill.remote.host-key`,
///   label "Sill Remote Access", looked up by its tag. Only the private key is stored; the public
///   one is derived from it.
/// - The recognition key: a generic password, service `me.saffer.sill.remote`, account
///   `recognition-key`, 32 bytes.
/// - The trust list: a generic password, same service, account `paired-devices`, JSON.
/// - Require pairing: a generic password, same service, account `require-pairing`: "1", or "0."
///   and a signature by the Mac's key (RequirePairingValue, docs/home-pairing-plan.md §4.8). A
///   missing item, or one without that signature, reads as on, so deleting it only turns pairing on.
///
/// **No migration from the login keychain — by design (the security review, 2026-09-27).** An
/// earlier draft copied a Mac's existing legacy items into the data-protection keychain on the first
/// entitled launch, to keep the Mac ID and pairings across the update. That reopened the very hole
/// this change closes: the login keychain cannot say who made an item, so the adoption code would
/// have adopted a *planted* legacy key just as readily as Sill's own, promoting an attacker's key
/// into the strong keychain as the Mac's permanent identity — and there is no sound gate on the
/// legacy side to tell the two apart (§3, §4 of docs/keychain-plan.md; ACL inspection is forgeable).
/// So in data-protection mode this store **never reads the login keychain**: every query is pinned to
/// the data-protection keychain by `scope()`, and a fresh install (or an entitled build's first
/// launch on a Mac that had legacy items) simply creates a fresh key straight in the strong keychain,
/// where the pre-creation guarantee is whole. This lands before the first public build, so the only
/// Macs with legacy items are Noah's own dev Macs, which do a one-time reset once (delete the legacy
/// items and re-pair; docs/keychain-plan.md §6, release-checklist.md Part 1 §5); public installs have
/// nothing to migrate.
///
/// Only an item that does not exist yet in this keychain is created. Any other failure to read one
/// throws: a new key would be a new Mac ID (every device's pin broken), and an empty list saved over
/// an unreadable one would forget every pairing. RemoteAccess then runs without an identity and the
/// pane says why.
///
/// **Availability (data-protection mode).** Every item is `AfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`: readable
/// once the Mac has been unlocked after boot, so remote access works while the screen is later locked
/// (its whole point is a Mac left at home while its owner is away), but never synced to iCloud and
/// never carried to another Mac in a keychain restore, so the identity key cannot leave this Mac
/// (the same posture as the iOS device key, WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly). The legacy store keeps the
/// login keychain's own default, as it always did.
