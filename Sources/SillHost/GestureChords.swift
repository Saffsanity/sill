// (docs/trackpad-gestures-plan.md §7). The device names the gesture; this Mac decides what it does,
// from its own Keyboard Shortcuts as they are at that moment (SymbolicHotKeys reads them), so a
// shortcut changed there is followed and one turned off does nothing: never another action's
// shortcut, never a guess. It also remembers the view its last gesture opened, so the opposite
// gesture closes it, as on a Mac's trackpad.

// `package` access needs -package-name). Nothing here posts anything: the coordinator posts the
// chord a `.chord` outcome names (InputInjector.chord), and a host that does not advertise posts
// none.
