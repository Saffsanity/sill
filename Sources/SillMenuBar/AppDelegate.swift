/// Sill.app: the Mac host as a menu bar app. The same StreamCoordinator as the CLI, under the
/// AppKit loop the virtual display needs, with a status item for what it is doing, Settings for
/// the knobs, and a Log window for what the CLI would have printed.
///
/// THE MODAL-LOOP RULE. Never start a nested modal loop from `Task { @MainActor }`, an async
/// continuation or a `DispatchQueue.main` block: NSMenu.popUp, NSAlert.runModal, NSApp.runModal,
/// NSSavePanel.runModal, and NSApp.terminate whenever it can answer .terminateLater. The main
/// queue is serial, so while that loop runs every host hop waits behind it (input, client
/// messages, source switches, the stats line), and a terminate issued from a Task never gets its
/// reply. Both were measured (design workflow, 2026-09-23). Start them only from AppKit
/// target/action, SwiftUI Button actions or a run-loop Timer, and show errors inline, never in an
/// alert.
///
/// App code may call `MainActor.assumeIsolated` in main-queue callbacks, because the app always
/// runs NSApplication and its main queue is the main thread. The host core may not: the CLI's
/// dispatchMain drains the main queue on a worker thread, where that call traps.
