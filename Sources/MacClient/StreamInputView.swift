/// (InputEvent, kind 8; gestures, kind 28), as the iOS app's overlay does for touches:
///
/// - The pointer: a move over the picture, a fraction of the frame; with a button down, clamped to
///   the frame, so a drag past the edge keeps going. Left, right and middle buttons (the middle one
///   only to a Mac that takes it); the host counts double and triple clicks itself.
/// - Scrolling: the trackpad's own phases and momentum, as the host expects from a trackpad
///   (began, deltas, ended, then momentumBegan, deltas, momentumEnded); a mouse wheel's bare deltas.
///   Deltas are a fraction of the frame as shown, in AppKit's sign, which is the wire's (positive
///   moves the content down or right).
/// - Keys: every key while the view has the keyboard, read before the menus see it (a local
///   monitor), so ⌘W and ⌘Q go to the Mac being controlled, not to this app; ⌘Tab, ⌘Space and the
///   other shortcuts macOS takes before any app only with Capture System Shortcuts (`SystemKeyTap`).
/// - Gestures: a swipe that reaches the app goes as the host's three-finger gesture; the Mac menu
///   (SillClientApp) sends each by name.
///
/// While the pointer is over the picture this Mac's own cursor takes the Mac's shape (kind 14), so
/// it moves at this Mac's rate with no round trip; the sprite shows only while the other Mac's
